It felt full circle to illustrate them on the one-year anniversary of coming to Columbia."

    "description": "I first discovered the entrance of Earl Hall during the first meeting of Artists Reaching Out, a wonderful association that I am grateful to be a part of. I had just started my first semester at Columbia, and getting involved in clubs and activities on campus was pretty challenging. Yet, getting to know the people of Artists Reaching Out and discussing our shared interests in art, education, and teaching felt surprisingly easy. I always believed that the setting was a factor in how great my first impression of community service at Columbia was. The summer breeze under the trees and the light that was bathing the steps of Earl Hall definitely contributed to my enjoyment of campus, and made it feel a bit more like home."

I wanted to capture the different friends I went with this past year and the kinds of projects we worked on together, such as paper marbling and designing shirts. Delia and Yisel, the two right above the door, are two of the many awesome people who will help guide you in your projects and answer any questions if needed. I hope that during your time here you can consider yourself a “maker” and design something of your own at the Design Center!"

    "description": "Julia’s Garden, previously known as the West 111th Street People’s Garden, is a little nook of greenery and a place of whimsy. Heading south from campus along Amsterdam Avenue, it’s really easy to walk right past while on the hunt for some tasty pastries from Hungarian. However, once you step inside its gates, you’ll find a small path winding through beds of vibrant flowers and tall trees. When the weather’s nice, I really enjoy sitting at the tables in the back of the garden and reading, sketching, or just people-watching. Sometimes there’ll even be little bird visitors! Visiting the garden always helps me take a deep breath, reset, and enjoy the sunshine. As the semester begins to pick up, I hope that you too can enjoy the garden and find within it a bit of calm and respite."

    "description": "When you press on the button for the sixth floor in the Diana Center elevator, the doors open up to just a small study lounge with a beautiful mural on one side and a window wall with a view of campus. In between are couches and tables where students can do their work with friends. During the day, the tables are almost always occupied. However, as an architecture student who spends late nights and early mornings in the studios on the fourth floor of Diana, the sixth floor study lounge is my favorite place to take a break and relax, or even take a nap on the sofas! Being in there all alone during sunrise and watching the buildings through the window glow orange gives a strange yet peaceful feeling that I will never forget."
